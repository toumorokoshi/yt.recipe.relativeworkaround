# yt.recipe.relativeworkaround

This is a buildout recipe that will fix an annoying with buildout: when the
relative-paths options is turned on, it will still use the absolute path when referencing
the buildout root:

    # buildout.cfg
    [buildout]
    relative-paths = true

    [scripts]
    recipe = z3c.recipe.scripts:scripts
    eggs =
        fabric
    interpreter = python


The result is absloute paths still added in various places:

    $ cat parts/scripts/site.py | grep `pwd`
        '/Users/yusuket/stash/TOOL/shipit'


Run this recipe at the end of your build, and it will do it's best to
correct them to the proper values.
